**Wiring**

This is a "shared SPI" system as much as possible to keep wiring manageable. The screen is a shared SPI, meaning touch, screen and SD card all use the same same MOSI MISO and SCK, but they have different CS pins to distinguish them. I later implement dynamic driver installation in the code to futher distinguish these.

_Build one - prototyping with breadboard_

Several inputs need to share common lines, so we are going to use a breadboard to break out pins for prototyping. Youll notice in the initial build photos this becomes quite a wiring nest. I cleaned it up later with custom cut solid core wire, so if you have the time I recommend starting there. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
Orange - top red rail - 3.3v
Red - top blue rail - 5v
Black - bottom red rail - Ground - double up for clearer signals

SPI Hub BOTTOM SIDE:

SCK Clock - blue wire- GPIO 12 - Row 1 bottom
MOSI - brown wire GPIO 11 Row 2 bottom
MISO - yellow wire GPIO 13 Row 10 bottom

I2S Hub UPPER SIDE:

BCLK - audio clock - purple wire GPIO 4 Row 1 top
LRC - word select - white wire GPIO 5 Row 5 top

CS Screen - purple wire GPIO 10
DC red wire gpio 9
RST green wire gpio 3
T_CS (Touch): -> GPIO 14 (Direct)
LED: -> 3.3V Hub (Or 5V if you want max brightness, but 3.3V is safer).

2. The Microphone (INMP441)
VDD: -> 3.3V Hub (Do NOT use 5V, it will fry).
GND: -> GND Hub
SCK: -> I2S Hub Row D (BCLK)
WS: -> I2S Hub Row E (LRC)
SD: -> GPIO 7 (Direct - Data In).
L/R: -> GND Hub (This sets it to "Left Channel" or Mono).

3. The Amplifier (MAX98357A)
VIN: -> 5V Hub (Louder volume)
GND: -> GND Hub
BCLK: -> I2S Hub Row D (BCLK)
LRC: -> I2S Hub Row E (LRC)
DIN: -> GPIO 6 (Direct - Data Out)
GAIN: -> (Leave empty or connect to GND via resistor for lower volume)
SD: -> (Leave empty, internal pull-up to turn on)

4. The Servos (Muscles)
Brown: -> GND Hub
Red: -> 5V Hub
Orange (Pan): -> GPIO 1
Orange (Tilt): -> GPIO 2
2 100uF capacitors - long leg 5v, short striped leg to ground. 1 for each servo.
