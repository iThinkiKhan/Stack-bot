# Stack-bot
 
I decided to upgrade the brain and display of the bot, primarily. I also wanted to use common parts and 3d prints I could order from the local library. 

**Hardware**
Brain - Lonely Binary ESP32-S3 N16R8. 16MB flash, 8MB octal PSRAM. Powerful little chip by esp32 standards. We need it to drive all the functions.

Display - 2.8" IL19341 Touch Screen. SPI interface (important to keep cables down) 320x240 resolution. This should enable us to display all kinds of data effectively, or act as a button, etc. This also gives us an SD slot.

Movement - 2x SG90 Servos. Can be upgraded to x6 for walking version.

**_Warning_** -Some of the pins on this board are used for the extra RAM. Do not use those pins. 

**3D Printing & Assembly**

Head - Case for 2.8" IL19341, bottom power by DorffMeister
  Body_-_Bottom_Power.stl
  Lid_-_Bottom_Power.stl

  Body - Standard StackChan repo from meganataaan 
    feet_SG90.stl
    bracket_SG90_b.stl

These do not fit together. Rough up the horns and superglue em.

**Software**

Development Environment
IDE: VS Code + PlatformIO
Framework: Arduino

The "Dual Brain" System
The firmware is designed to be model-agnostic, allowing hot-swapping between AI providers via a preprocessor flag (#define USE_GEMINI).

_Primary Brain (Google Gemini)_:

Model: gemini-1.5-flash
Cost: Free Tier
Role: Daily driver

_Backup Brain (OpenAI)_:

Model: ChatGPT
Cost: Paid API
Role: Fallback or complex reasoning tasks.

Secrets Management
API keys and WiFi credentials are stored in a non-tracked src/Secrets.h file to prevent accidental leaks.

**Wiring**
This is a "shared SPI" system as much as possible to keep wiring manageable. The screen is a shared SPI, meaning touch, screen and SD card all use the same same MOSI MISO and SCK, but they have different CS pins to distinguish them.

_Build one - prototyping with breadboard_

Several inputs need to share common lines, so we are going to use a breadboard to break out pins for prototyping.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Orange - top red rail - 3.3v
Red - top blue rail - 5v
Black - bottom red rail - Ground - double up for clearer signals

SPI Hub BOTTOM SIDE:

SCK Clock - blue wire- GPIO 12 - Row 1 bottom
MOSI - brown wire GPIO 11 Row 2 bottom
MISO - yellow wire GPIO 13 Row 10 bottom

I2S Hub UPPER SIDE:

BCLK - audio clock - purple wire GPIO 4 Row 1 top
LRC - word select - white wire GPIO 5 Row 5 top

CS Screen - purple wire GPIO 10
DC red wire gpio 9
RST green wire gpio 3
T_CS (Touch): -> GPIO 14 (Direct)
LED: -> 3.3V Hub (Or 5V if you want max brightness, but 3.3V is safer).

2. The Microphone (INMP441)
VDD: -> 3.3V Hub (Do NOT use 5V, it will fry).
GND: -> GND Hub
SCK: -> I2S Hub Row D (BCLK)
WS: -> I2S Hub Row E (LRC)
SD: -> GPIO 7 (Direct - Data In).
L/R: -> GND Hub (This sets it to "Left Channel" or Mono).

3. The Amplifier (MAX98357A)
VIN: -> 5V Hub (Louder volume).
GND: -> GND Hub
BCLK: -> I2S Hub Row D (BCLK)
LRC: -> I2S Hub Row E (LRC)
DIN: -> GPIO 6 (Direct - Data Out).
GAIN: -> (Leave empty or connect to GND via resistor for lower volume).
SD: -> (Leave empty, it has an internal pull-up to turn on).

4. The Servos (Muscles)
Brown: -> GND Hub
Red: -> 5V Hub
Orange (Pan): -> GPIO 1
Orange (Tilt): -> GPIO 2
2 100uF capacitors - long leg 5v, short striped leg to ground. 1 for each servo.
