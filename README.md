# Franken-bot (Frank)
 
I decided to upgrade the brain and display (2.8in touch w/ SD card slot) of the StackChan to improve usability as a desk companion. I also wanted to use common, cheap/salvaged parts and 3d prints I could order from the local library.

**Hardware**

Brain - _Lonely Binary ESP32-S3 N16R8_.  Dual core FreeRTOS architecture and dynamic driver switching for shared SPI bus. Optimized memory handling.

Display - _2.8" IL19341 Touch Screen_. SPI interface (important to keep cables down) 320x240 resolution. This should enable us to display all kinds of data effectively, or act as a button, etc. Added SD slot.

Movement - _2x SG90 Servos_. Can be upgraded to x6 for walking capability (untested).

**3D Printing & Assembly**

Head - Case for 2.8" IL19341, bottom power by DorffMeister
  Body_-_Bottom_Power.stl
  Lid_-_Bottom_Power.stl

  Body - Standard StackChan repo from meganataaan 
    feet_SG90.stl
    bracket_SG90_b.stl

These cases do not fit together. Rough up the horns of the server arms and and superglue em.


**Software:**

**OSv2.5 'Frank'** 

-Fixed dynamic driver handling - automatic handling had many bugs, mostly pointer resolution after automatic delete of previous driver
-Smoothed audio - fixed a looping issue that caused audio stutter, added 100KB buffer in PSRAM for audio to address latency, forced mono mode
-Auto-Model Select - Frank will now look at available Gemini models and choose the best one for him. _NOT ABLE TO USE TEXT TO SPEECH MODELS YET_
-Changed name from Stack-bot to Franken-bot. Codename 'Frank'

**OSv2-multithreading**

My first working RTOS for the system which incorporates all the sensors. I am not a coder, but Gemini sure is. I ended up doing multithreading and some clever memory management (my first stack overflow!) to handle some of the larger functions without crashing the rather small default esp32 void loop. To that end, I spawned two dedicated FreeRTOS tasks with explicit memory allocation. brainTask exclusively handles AI, SSL and JSON processing with a 40KB stack. robotTask handles the I/O and provides 20KB. Void loop was then left empty. I also implemented dynamic driver swapping, which uninstalls the mic or speaker driver before installing the other. The global JSON buffers were moved to heap memory as well, since the buffers get massive. There are tons of other bug fixes, like properly sharing the buses, but this is confirmed working with everyhting except the SD card. Serves mostly as a proof of concept and launching off point - code is above under OSv2 - multithreading.  



**Software Enviornment**

Development Environment
IDE: VS Code + PlatformIO
Framework: Arduino

The "Dual Brain" System
The custom operating systems here are designed to be model-agnostic, allowing hot-swapping between AI providers or local models via a preprocessor flag (comment out #define USE_GEMINI for OpenAI).

_Primary Brain (Google Gemini)_:

Model: gemini-1.5-flash
Cost: Free Tier
Role: Daily driver

_Backup Brain (OpenAI)_:

Model: ChatGPT
Cost: Paid API
Role: Fallback or complex reasoning tasks.
